# AcousticPotentialSimulation
This is a program that allows for the calculation and display of the Accoustic Levitation Potential of a sound field created between an ultrasonic transducer and a reflector.

This program constitutes part of a final year project for the award of a Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Limerick.

This program is a python implementation of the method described by *Kozuka, T. et al* in their paper *Acoustic Standing-Wave Field for Manipulation in Air*, published in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics in 2008.
